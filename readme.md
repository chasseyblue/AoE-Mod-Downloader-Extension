# AoE2 DE Mod downloader Chrome Extension Fork

Reinterpreted into a Chrome Extension for Microsoft Edge for ease of use and allowing on the fly changes by just pasting the mod ID into a text field and clicking the fetch mod button.
Fork of alyti's console code: https://gist.github.com/alyti/24459f6e2d5eba2cab10aca27d29470b
Only difference here is a UI based approach as a Chromium Extension.
